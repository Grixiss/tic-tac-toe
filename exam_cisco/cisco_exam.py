2. enter_move(board)

    Input: Current board state.
    Output: Update the board with the user's move.
    Process:
        Repeat until a valid move is entered:
            Prompt the user for a move (number 1-9).
            Validate if the input is an integer between 1 and 9.
            Calculate the row and column based on the user's input.
            Check if the selected cell is empty:
                If yes, place 'O' in the cell and break the loop.
                If no, prompt the user to choose another cell.

3. make_list_of_free_fields(board)

    Input: Current board state.
    Output: List of free cells in the format (row, column).
    Process:
        Initialize an empty list for free fields.
        For each cell in the board:
            If the cell is not occupied by 'O' or 'X':
                Add the cell's (row, column) to the free fields list.
        Return the list of free fields.
